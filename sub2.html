                <h1>COVID-19 as a global Challenge</h1><br></br>
                <p>              
                    With the COVID-19 pandemic, we are living through a world crisis the likes of which hasn’t been seen in 100 years.<br></br>
                    
                    The enormous scale of the crisis and the impact it is having are naturally causing a lot of fear, uncertainty and anxiety across the globe. Add social isolation, disrupted work and family routines, cabin fever and economic instability, and it is understandable that our mental health is suffering. In a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 45% of adults feel that worry and stress related to coronavirus has had a negative impact on their mental health.<br></br>
                    
                    The COVID-19 situation is particularly stressful because it’s hard to predict how things will develop, and our circumstances are changing rapidly. This can leave us feeling powerless, like we’re no longer in control of our own lives. As is the case in many aspects of our lives, there are things we can’t control in this situation. These include the actions and reactions of other people, how long the situation will last, and what might happen in the future.<br></br>
                    
                    Although these things might leave us feeling helpless, in reality there are still a lot of things we have power over in our lives, even during these trying times. Redirecting our energy towards these things will help us deal effectively with this situation.<br></br>

            <div class="bottom">
                <br></br>
                <h2>Here is our list of things that you can control to help you to maintain good mental health and resilience during these challenging times.</h2><br></br>
                <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><li>Your Thougts & Worries</li></h3><br></br>
                   <p>Stress and anxiety are often accompanied by an overactive mind, full of circling thoughts and worries. Writing your thoughts down in a journal is a simple, yet highly effective method for calming a frantic mind. A good place to keep this journal is beside your bed, as it’s often when we are trying to sleep that buzzing thoughts are the most troublesome.
                    <br></br>
                    Problem solving can also help you to manage your thoughts and worries. It allows you to define exactly what you are worrying about, and then find the best solution.</p><br></br>
                    <h3 style="font-size:120%;"><li>Your Social Connections</li></h3><br></br>
            <p>Social isolation is one of the biggest mental health challenges we are facing with this crisis. Many people are living alone or away from their support systems, which are usually essential wellbeing boosters in a time of crisis. We are tactile, social creatures by nature, so a lack of physical contact can be extremely difficult for us to cope with.
                <br></br>
                Maintaining social connections is crucial to your wellbeing at this time. Use all the tools available to you - phone or video calls, emails, letter writing, and social media, to stay in regular contact with your friends, family and communities. Remember that this period of isolation will end, so use this time to strengthen your connections, rather than letting them fade.</p><br></br>
            <h4 style="font-size:120%;"><li>Your Self-Care</li></h4><br></br>
            <p>Looking after yourself is an essential part of maintaining your energy levels and your resilience to stress. Airlines advise you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping other people. The same idea goes for self-care - you need to look after yourself first, in order to be there for other people.<br></br>Eat a healthy diet, get as much fresh air and daylight as possible, make sure you are getting enough good quality sleep, exercise sleep, spend time doing things you enjoy.</p><br></br>
            <h5 style="font-size:120%;"><li>Your Routine</li></h5><br></br> 
            <p>We are creatures of habit, so disruptions to our usual routines can add stress to what is already a challenging time. Creating a new routine can bring structure back into your life. It also breaks up your time and prevents the days from blending into each other. Try to get up at the usual time, get dressed as you normally would and stick to regular mealtimes.

                <br></br>It is also important to recognize that in a time of crisis, you are unlikely to fulfill all your roles and responsibilities in the way you normally would. For example, you may now find yourself parenting and working simultaneously. Prioritizing your time will ensure that you make time for the important things, while being realistic about what you can achieve.</p></br>     
            <h6 style="font-size:120%;"><li>Your Environment</li></h6><br></br>
            <p>You are more than likely spending a lot of time at home at the moment, so it is worth making your environment as comfortable as possible. Think about how you can make it a more pleasant place to be – can you clean or declutter your space, or decorate it with photos or pictures? What about the smells and sounds in your environment, how could you improve these?  

            <br></br>This is particularly important if you are isolating yourself and are confined to just one room. If possible, assign different activities to different areas in your room – one corner for working, another for relaxing, listening to music or reading.</p><br></br>
